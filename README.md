The application allows users to search for movies by title and display a list of matching movies with basic information about each one.

Users can click on a movie from the list, and they link to a details page that displays more information about that movie, such as plot, actors, and ratings.

In order for the user to find a movie, has been implemented **Search bar** in which the user can search for a movie that interests him.

since the users get only 10 movies after completing the search query, at the first page of the application implemented **Pagination**, which allows users to see the rest of the movies.

Users have the ability to **Save their favorite movies** to favorites, view saved movies on a separate page of the application, and remove movies from favorites.

This feature is implemented using the Redux Toolkit state manager.
